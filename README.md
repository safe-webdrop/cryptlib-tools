# cryptlib-tools
 cryptlib-tools is a collection of single stand-alone tools, that cover all aspects
 of one specific encryption problem, be it conventional symmetric file encryption (AES),
 public key management, RSA encryption, email message encryption (S/MIME),
 CA services or SSH and TLS sessions.
 
 All cryptlib-tools, the AES file encryption tool (claes), the public/private key management
 tool (clkeys) and the public key encryption tool (clsmime) are based on Cryptlib and are
 coded in Python3.

 All cryptlib tools can replace complex OpenSSL code by using Cryptlib and are designed
 to interoperate with programs that are widely used and established like gpg2 and openssl.
